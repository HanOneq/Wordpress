GreyRound is the first ever theme that I have fully
developed from scratch. I am looking forward to your
suggestions, ideas and feedback! I am sure this theme
can be made better and more compact, responsive etc.
If you have any new suggestions please don't hesitate
to reach out!

It is completely optional, but if you like the Theme I
would appreciate it if you keep the credit link at the
bottom.
